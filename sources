Back to the main story, as other people described, .wav format only stores the amplitude of energy level in each sample, from which you can plot an amplitudes versus time graph first. This is also known as the time domain of a waveform. You can then use a mathematical principle called 'Fourier Transform' to convert the time domain into the frequency domain, which tells you the information about what frequencies are detected and relatively how often they are detected in this waveform.
